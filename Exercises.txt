1) Install an Ubuntu VM. Write code with vi in the terminal, so that you don't utilize Visual Studio's online compilation capability.
2) Write a program that uses a while loop to read words from standard input (cin) into a string. This is an “infinite” while loop, which you break out of (and exit the program) using a break statement. For each word that is read, evaluate it by first using a sequence of if statements to “map” an integral value to the word, and then use a switch statement that uses that integral value as its selector (this sequence of events is not meant to be good programming style; it’s just supposed to give you exercise with control flow). Inside each case, print something meaningful. You must decide what the “interesting” words are and what the meaning is. You must also decide what word will signal the end of the program.
